Chatbots are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with users in meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails. 

Crowdsourcer is a BOT that helps a group of people (team) collaborate to obtain voluntary answers to their queries in a fun and transparent manner. It works on the principle of tapping on to the crowd intelligence and collective wisdom of the group.
